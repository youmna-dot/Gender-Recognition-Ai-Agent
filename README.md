# Gender Recognition AI Agent

## 📌 Description
This project uses a TensorFlow Lite model to recognize gender (Male or Female) from an image.

## 📁 Files
- `model_unquant.tflite`: The trained TFLite model.
- `labels.txt`: File containing class labels.
- `ai_agent.py`: Main script for prediction.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Upload an image from your device or use the camera.
2. Run the `ai_agent.py` script in a Python environment that supports TensorFlow Lite.
3. The model will display the predicted gender along with the confidence score.

## 📚 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow Lite
- Keras
- OpenCV (for handling images and camera input)
